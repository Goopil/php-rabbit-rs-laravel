/**
 * Per-connection ready-depth sampler for the rabbit-rs:work auto-scaler.
 *
 * Two sources, chosen per connection, summed over the connection's planned
 * queues:
 *
 * 1. The RabbitMQ management API (pending depth: `messages_ready` plus
 *    `messages_unacknowledged`, #308) when the connection
 *    configures `management_url` — the zero-AMQP source, and the only one
 *    that still counts after every worker has exited (the one-shot final
 *    depth check).
 * 2. Otherwise a passive native probe (`Pool::size()`, the same passive
 *    declare the doctor and topology commands use): no management plugin
 *    is required, but while the sampler lives the supervisor holds one
 *    extra AMQP connection per connection, and each lookup blocks up to
 *    the connection's socket timeout.
 *
 * Every lookup degrades to null (request failure, unreachable broker,
 * missing queue, extension absent): the caller silently leaves the
 * connection out of scaling — same contract as the management API. A
 * configured-but-failing management endpoint therefore
 * disables scaling for that connection rather than cascading into the
 * native probe. The supervisor never publishes, so its probe pools hold no
 * publish buffer and need no force-flush before size().
 *
 * Native probe pools are created lazily on first lookup and reused for the
 * sampler's lifetime; a failed lookup closes and drops the pool so the
 * next pass reconnects from scratch.
 *
 * Native lookups (seam and real probe alike) are memoized per connection
 * and queue for {@see NATIVE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS}: the supervisor samples on
 * every scale pass and once-mode drain check, so an unmemoized fallback
 * would pay one blocking AMQP round-trip per pass — and a slow or half-open
 * broker would turn the failure path's reconnect into a blocking retry
 * spin (issue #272). A failed probe is memoized for the TTL as well, so
 * the loop retries at most once per window; the management API path is
 * never cached (its HTTP client is already bounded).
