| Rabbit RS — Native RabbitMQ Queue Driver
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This file is the entry point for configuring the Rabbit RS native queue
| driver. The driver delegates all AMQP I/O to a Rust extension that
| manages connection pools, publisher confirms, consumer scheduling,
| and automatic recovery — none of which runs in PHP userspace.
|
| The config is normalised at runtime by ConfigNormalizer, which validates
| every value and provides actionable error messages when something is
| misconfigured.

    | Brokers
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Each broker entry describes a connection pool. A vhost owns a distinct
    | AMQP connection — publisher channels are pooled, consumer channels are
    | dedicated. You can define multiple brokers to connect to different
    | vhosts or clusters simultaneously.
    |
    | hosts:       Comma-separated list of host:port endpoints. The pool
    |              connects to the first available and fails over on recovery.
    |              IPv6 addresses must be bracketed: [::1]:5672
    |
    | vhost:       AMQP virtual host. Each unique vhost gets its own
    |              connection within the pool.
    |
    | credentials: Plain username/password. Never logged or exposed in Debug.
    |
    | tls:         TLS settings. Set enabled=true for amqps://. The ca_cert
    |              is required for server certificate verification. client_cert
    |              and client_key enable mTLS.
    |
    | heartbeat:   AMQP heartbeat in seconds. If no data is exchanged for
    |              2× this interval, the connection is considered dead and
    |              recovery kicks in. Keep below your TCP keepalive threshold.

    | Workers
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Each worker profile defines a set of subscriptions consumed by a
    | single `rabbit-rs:work` process. The native scheduler multiplexes
    | subscriptions on a dedicated channel per consumer.
    |
    | scheduler.strategy:     Currently only "weighted_fair" is supported.
    |                         The scheduler distributes consumer credit
    |                         across subscriptions proportional to weight.
    |
    | subscriptions:          Each subscription binds the worker to a queue on
    |                         a broker. A worker can subscribe to multiple
    |                         queues with different weights and priorities.
    |
    |   enabled:            Set to false to skip this subscription without
    |                       removing it from config.
    |
    |   broker:              Must reference a broker defined above.
    |
    |   queue:               The AMQP queue to consume from.
    |
    |   weight:              Relative weight in the weighted-fair scheduler.
    |                       Higher weight gets more consumer credit.
    |
    |   priority_class:      Integer priority class (-32768 to 32767).
    |                       Lower numbers are higher priority on quorum
    |                       queues. The scheduler groups subscriptions by
    |                       class and serves the highest priority first.
    |
    |   prefetch.mode:       Currently only "fixed" is supported.
    |   prefetch.value:      QoS prefetch count. The broker delivers at most
    |                       this many unacked messages per consumer channel.
    |
    |   starvation_after:    Seconds without a delivery before the scheduler
    |                       boosts this subscription's weight to prevent
    |                       starvation by heavier-weight subscriptions.
    |
    |   early_ack:           When true, deliveries are auto-acked before
    |                       dispatch to PHP. Requires best_effort=true.
    |                       If PHP crashes, in-flight messages are lost.
    |
    |   no_ack:              When true + early_ack=true + best_effort=true,
    |                       the broker auto-acks deliveries internally — no
    |                       ack frames are sent at all. Eliminates all ack
    |                       round-trips for maximum throughput.

    |                    message to a bounded background pump and returns
    |                    without waiting for any transport outcome — a transport
