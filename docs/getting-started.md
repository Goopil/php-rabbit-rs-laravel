# Getting started — Laravel queue driver

Rabbit RS ships as a standard Laravel queue driver: jobs are dispatched with the usual `Job::dispatch()` API and consumed by the usual `queue:work` — the connection pooling, publisher confirms, scheduling, and recovery run natively in Rust underneath. This guide goes from a first delivered message to production operation in four levels.

The same engine is also usable without Laravel — see the [native extension getting started](https://github.com/Goopil/php-rabbit-rs/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md).

## Install

```bash
# Native extension (Linux via PIE)
pie install goopil/rabbit-rs-native

# Laravel queue driver (service provider auto-discovered)
composer require goopil/rabbit-rs-laravel
```

Details — macOS (Homebrew), Docker, manual binaries: the [installation guide](https://github.com/Goopil/php-rabbit-rs/blob/main/docs/reference.md#installation). Requirements: PHP 8.4/8.5, Laravel 12/13, a reachable RabbitMQ 4.2.9+ broker.

## 1. Hello world

Add one connection to `config/queue.php` — one connection = one broker/vhost = one native pool:

```php
'connections' => [
    'rabbit-rs' => [
        'driver' => 'rabbit-rs',
        'queue' => env('RABBIT_RS_QUEUE', 'default'),
        'hosts' => env('RABBIT_RS_HOSTS', '127.0.0.1:5672'),
        'username' => env('RABBIT_RS_USERNAME', 'guest'),
        'password' => env('RABBIT_RS_PASSWORD', 'guest'),
    ],
],
```

```bash
QUEUE_CONNECTION=rabbit-rs   # .env
```

Every other key falls back to the package defaults — quorum queues, `safe` publishing, prefetch 64. Dispatch and consume:

```php
// app/Jobs/ProcessOrder.php — a standard Laravel job, nothing to change
class ProcessOrder implements ShouldQueue
{
    use Dispatchable, Queueable;

    public function __construct(public int $orderId) {}
}

ProcessOrder::dispatch(42);
ProcessOrder::dispatch(43)->delay(now()->addMinutes(5));
```

```bash
php artisan queue:work rabbit-rs     # consume one connection
php artisan rabbit-rs:work           # or: supervised fan-out, one child per rabbit-rs connection
```

The queue is declared on first use (`topology_mode: declare`). `rabbit-rs:work` supervises the children — crash restarts with exponential backoff, graceful stop on `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`.

## 2. Reliability

Delivery is **at-least-once**: once a message is accepted into the confirmed delivery path, silent loss is unacceptable, and duplicates are permitted and measurable. Jobs **must be idempotent** — the stable `message_id` (UUID from the Laravel payload) is the deduplication key. Full contract: [Reliability](https://github.com/Goopil/php-rabbit-rs/blob/main/docs/reference.md#reliability).

The `safety` key selects the publisher guarantees (default `safe`: publisher confirms plus mandatory routing — there is no separate `mandatory` switch, it follows the safety mode). In `safe` mode every publish is tracked to ACK, return, or timeout; unconfirmed publications survive connection recovery in bounded process memory and are replayed with their original `message_id`. That replay buffer is **process memory, not durability**: it does not survive a PHP crash, and cross-process durability needs an external outbox.

The one production must-do: bound redeliveries with a delivery limit and a dead-letter exchange, so poison messages are routed instead of looped forever:

```php
'rabbit-rs' => [
    // ...
    'delivery_limit' => 20,          // after 20 redeliveries, dead-letter
    'dead_letter' => [
        'exchange' => 'dead-letters',
        'queue' => 'failed-jobs',
        'routing_key' => null,       // null = keep the original routing key
    ],
],
```

## 3. Scale

**Multiple brokers/vhosts** — define one connection per broker; the framework's own way to express multiple backends:

```php
'connections' => [
    'orders-eu' => [
        'driver' => 'rabbit-rs',
        'queue' => 'orders',
        'hosts' => ['rabbit-1:5672', 'rabbit-2:5672'],
        'vhost' => '/orders-eu',
        'username' => 'orders',
        'password' => env('ORDERS_PASSWORD'),
        'exchange' => 'laravel.jobs',
    ],
    'billing' => [
        'driver' => 'rabbit-rs',
        'queue' => 'invoices',
        'hosts' => 'rabbit-3:5672',
        'vhost' => '/billing',
        'username' => 'billing',
        'password' => env('BILLING_PASSWORD'),
        'exchange' => 'billing.jobs',
    ],
],
```

```php
BillingJob::dispatch($invoice)->onConnection('billing');
```

```bash
php artisan rabbit-rs:work --connection=orders-eu,billing
```

**Several queues per connection** — the `subscriptions` escape hatch fans deliveries through one weighted-fair consumer:

```php
'orders-eu' => [
    // ...
    'subscriptions' => [
        'critical' => ['queue' => 'orders.critical', 'weight' => 8, 'priority_class' => 1, 'prefetch' => 8],
        'bulk' => ['queue' => 'orders.bulk', 'weight' => 2, 'prefetch' => 32, 'starvation_after' => 60],
    ],
],
```

`weight` (1–65535) sets each subscription's delivery share; `priority_class` serves higher numbers first; `starvation_after` protects low-priority subscriptions from aging out. `prefetch` also accepts an adaptive controller that keeps about `target_buffer_seconds` of ready work buffered:

```php
'prefetch' => ['mode' => 'adaptive', 'initial' => 64, 'min' => 1, 'max' => 256, 'target_buffer_seconds' => 5],
```

## 4. Operate

| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `php artisan rabbit-rs:work` | Supervised fan-out worker (`--connection`, `--queue`, `--workers`, `--max-restarts`, `--backoff`) |
| `php artisan rabbit-rs:status` | Per-connection pool metrics and counters; `--format=json` for monitoring |
| `php artisan rabbit-rs:doctor` | One-shot health report — `ok`/`warn`/`fail` checks, non-zero exit on failure (CI-friendly) |
| `php artisan rabbit-rs:topology` | Preflight topology check; `--fix` declares missing topology |
| `php artisan rabbit-rs:probe` | Kubernetes probes (`startup`/`ready`/`alive`/`prestop`) over the worker statefiles; liveness never touches the broker |

Details: [Operations](reference.md#operations) (supervision, Kubernetes, metrics), [Laravel usage](reference.md#usage) (dispatch API, events, job class).

**Horizon** — set `RABBIT_RS_WORKER=horizon` (or `'worker' => 'horizon'` on the connection) and Rabbit RS jobs appear in the Horizon dashboard alongside Redis jobs — configured in `config/horizon.php` exactly like a Redis queue; Redis stores observability state while RabbitMQ stays the transport. Setup and the event contract: [Laravel usage — Horizon](reference.md#laravel-horizon).

**Octane** — detected automatically: consumers are closed after each request, pools are flushed and re-normalized on worker reload, stopped on shutdown. No configuration needed — see [Octane](reference.md#octane-integration).
